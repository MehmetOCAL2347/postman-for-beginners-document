# Postman Course

## Welcome on Postman Course 🎉
Welcome to **Postman Course**! This project aims to learn API test.  
In my Udemy courses, I prefer showcasing and teaching with products I’ve developed myself. For my **Postman course**, I created this custom API to provide practical testing and learning experiences.  

This API is designed to:  
- Help students understand API testing fundamentals.  
- Provide real-world scenarios for testing with Postman.  

## API Features 🚀  
- **User Management** - Create, update, and manage user profiles.  
- **Authentication** - Learn to test secure endpoints.  
- **Dynamic Data Handling** - Test various request types and parameters.
